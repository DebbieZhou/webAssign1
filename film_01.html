            <p>男主角阿遠與他的青梅竹馬阿雲，在阿遠初中畢業後便先後相偕到台北謀生，阿雲到了台北之後體悟到城市居大不易，尤其阿遠不但要自給自足還要完成補校學業，更要寄錢貼補鄉下家用，生活十分辛苦，但小倆口卻也奮鬥得積極。兩人就是從小這樣一路走來，感情的過去與未來似乎就是這麼自然地形成，他們也從不懷疑這樣的關係。高中補校畢業後阿遠入伍當兵，很多事就在長距離的離別之後漸漸轉變，就在阿遠退伍前阿雲竟然嫁了別人，阿遠雖心痛卻沒有恨意，他常懷抱著的想法是：阿雲是個好女孩應該找到比自己更好的人託付終身。因此，他始終沒有找阿雲問明，只讓時間成為最好的良藥。

            <p>The male lead A-Yuan moves to Taipei to make a living after finishing junior high school. His childhood sweetheart, A-yun follows him to Taipei where she comes to realize that living in the city isn’t easy, especially for A-Yuan who not only has to sustain his own needs while finishing his supplementary high school studies, but also must send money back home to his folks in the country, which is particularly challenging for the two of them. They work hard, facing the challenges of life together and following a path that they have shared since childhood. Feelings from the past and the future seem to naturally crystallize, leaving no room for any doubt in their relationship. Having finished his supplementary studies and graduating high school, A-Yuan goes into the military to fulfill his compulsory service. Separated by the long distance and extended time apart, many aspects of their relationship change. Before he completes his military service, A-Yun marries someone else. Although he is saddened by the event, A-Yuan harbors no ill feelings toward A-Yun because he has always thought that she was a good girl and should find someone better than him.
